This is the starter code for ELEC350/351 C1. You should use the ARMC6 compiler to build this code in Mbed Studio.

**A pre-requisite for this is to complete the lab on networking https://github.com/UniversityOfPlymouth-Electronics/Embedded-Systems/blob/master/level6/network_programming.md**

This includes watching all the videos on setting up Microsoft Azure IoT Central.
